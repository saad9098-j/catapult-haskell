# Catapult (Haskell Core)

This repository contains the **Haskell implementation of the core game logic** for the Catapult project.  
It is a **Stack-based Haskell project** built using [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) and [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

## How to Build and Run

1. Install **GHCup** and **Stack**.  
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saad9098-j/catapult-haskell.git
   cd catapult-haskell
3. Initialize and build:
- stack init     
- stack build
- stack test (see the readme for more testing options)

## GUI

A separate Python GUI exists for this project, but it is not my implementation.
If you wish to use it, please explore the README provided in the GUI repository for setup and usage instructions.
